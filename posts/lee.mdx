I recently decided to redesign and revamp my site. I had a few main goals:

1. Easier content management for blog posts
2. Simplified, minimal design
3. Dark mode support

## Simplified Design
Before this redesign, I hand-rolled all of my components using styled-components. I was trying to maintain a consistent design, so I'd extract shared values out into a theme.
