# Why am I creating Aerospace Express?

There's a lack of good aerospace news aggregators, and a lack of aerospace foccused communities. There's reddit of course, but like youtube, once you go to reddit, you spend much more time in there than the time you had planned to spend. There is a need for a focused aerospace commnunity, a place that's just that, that serves one purpose and one purpose only. A place where we, aerospace enthusiasts, aerospace workers can be updated, can discuss and create the future of our industry.
